\partNoNumber{LAST DIARY ENTRIES}

\chapterNoNumber{Current Working On}

Hey, Max. So, these are the last entries I'm working on. 

If they are old entries, I'll be placing them in their correct order once I'm finished with them. If they are recent, they will stay here until I hit the cap of... 10 entries? 

Ok, this is it. I might even delete this part and section of this Journal once I'm done with it... which might be never lmao.

Ok, byee :v

% Hi, I am Norman. I want to write my own journal of my life. My main inspiration is Maxine from Life is Strange. I want to write a diary just like hers. I want to sound spontaneous, funny and cute, just like she does in her diary. Adding cute slangs, references and even inner thoughts with all kinds of jokes and feelings. The entries should sound like I am talking to Journal itself. Overall, I wanna make the entries for my diary something fun to read and quick. Could you help me with this by rewriting paragraphs that I will give you, making them just like Maxine's?
