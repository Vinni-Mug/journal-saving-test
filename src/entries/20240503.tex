\sectionNoNumber{Apr 03, 2025 - Goodbye, Helena.}

Hey there, Max! Whoa, today took a totally unexpected turn. It's been ages since Brooke advised me to block Helena, my ex, from, like, everywhere. And guess what? I finally mustered the courage to block her on Instagram last night. Go me, right? But, of course, the universe had other plans.

So, there I was at the gym today, getting my bike ready to head out, when BAM! Joelma, Helena's adorable dog, literally bumps into me. And before I could even process that, guess who shows up? Yep, Helena herself. Talk about awkward timing.

She said hi and all that. Then, she straight-up asks me if I blocked her on Instagram. I just stood there like a deer in headlights and didn't say a word. Then she starts telling me about accidentaly meeting my old school friend, Victor, a.k.a Vitão. Apparently, he was totally distraught when he saw her eating a pastel. At this point, I was super confused. I mean, was he hungry or something? So I joked, "Was he starving or what?" And then she drops the bomb: "No, he saw me with good company. He saw me having it with someone else. Thus, he was shocked."

Ouch. That hit me right in the feels. It hurt in a way I can't even describe. I broke eye contact, muttered, "I really didn't need to know that," and pedaled away like my life depended on it. As I rode off, I could faintly hear her say, "I am sorry," but it was too late. I was already gone.

After I got home, I had a video chat with Brooke. I spilled everything about the gym encounter with Helena and how I was totally not okay with it. Brooke, being the amazing wise sage she is, understood completely. She reminded me that I should've blocked Helena everywhere a long time ago and that it's pretty clear Helena gets some twisted pleasure from hurting me.

And then, mid-conversation, Helena sent me a sext on WhatsApp. Seriously, Max? I know this sounds bizarre, but I felt this weird need to save the conversation. I trust you, Max, so I thought I'd store it here with you. I might break down parts of it for context, but honestly, what matters is the conversation itself. I'll take screenshots and rewrite it here, just to be sure it's safe.

I get that I shouldn't keep this conversation, but being able to read it again is oddly comforting. It reminds me. It reminds me that she doesn't want me anymore, that she never wanted to fix things. It reminds me that the person she likes and wants, as she blatantly told me, is Diego, her professor. It makes me... accept that she cheated on me. There's no going back after today. I know this, Max, but keeping a record helps.

After this conversation, I blocked Helena… from everywhere. But I guess she'll always linger in my mind with all those memories I can't block, right? Anyway, here's the conversation, Max. I'm sorry for unloading this on you:

(Just FYI, if you pay attention, it looks like I unblocked her and, then, blocked again. That was pretty much me not knowing how blocking people works in Whatsapp. That "Adeus, Helena" was, indeed, my last ever message to her.)
