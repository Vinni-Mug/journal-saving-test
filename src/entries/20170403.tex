Heyy, Max. So... this was my 15th birthday. Yep.

\quad That awkward creature with the red cap, the weird bangs, and the blue shirt in the picture? That’s me. Please don’t judge him too hard. He was doing his best.

\quad I swear I had more photos from this day to glue here, but I guess Past Me trusted Instagram with his entire memory archive. Bold move. Terrible backup strategy. 

\quad Anyway—this was my first birthday in Serra Talhada, which is kinda wild to think about. 

\quad I’m writing this in 2026, so my brain is basically like: 404 Birthday Memories Not Found.

\quad What I do remember is that I tried to start a diary on this exact day.

Yeah. Baby’s first journal attempt. I was so obsessed with describing every single detail, like I was writing a novel or a Netflix limited series, that I… never finished the entry. Very on brand.

It was my birthday, after all. Obviously I had better things to do than commit to a long-term personal project.

I asked my family for no party, because I was in my “I’m mysterious and low-key” era. But Edilva—aka my mom, aka a woman who does not understand the word “no”—threw one anyway. And the worst part?
…it was actually really nice. Like, annoyingly nice. There was cake, a bunch of kids, way too many photos, and honestly? I had fun. I just wish I remembered more of it.

I remember texting Helena a lot that day, and her being like, “You didn’t even invite me! :<” which still feels very her. And very teenage-drama-core.

Oh—and the red cap? Birthday gift from my drunk uncle José. Iconic. Truly a legendary contribution to my character design.

So yeah.
Happy Birthday, Vinni.
You were awkward, dramatic, and already trying to write your life down.
Honestly? Not much has changed.
