\sectionNoNumber{Apr 03, 2002 - I was Born!}

Hey, Max. 
Not much to report, honestly.
I was just born today.
10/10 plot twist. Would do it again.

Can you feel it? You guys, do you feel this? My origin story begins. We're gonna be superheroes! (D'you catch the reference, Max?)

I wish I could give you a super detailed, poetic account of this day, but every time I ask about it, I get a different version. Like a family cinematic universe with multiple timelines.

According to one of them, my mom was pregnant with me and watching Big Brother Brasil.
And when the results came out and the person she was rooting for won, she got so excited that she jumped.
Cue dramatic music.
Water breaks.
Hospital speedrun.
A few hours later—around 2 a.m.—boom.
Me.
Welcome to the world... Vinicius.

Is this story 100\% accurate?
No idea.
Does it sound slightly exaggerated?
Absolutely.
But it’s also kinda perfect.
I literally entered existence because of reality TV and excitement.

Anyway, Max.
This is where it all starts.
No memories, no thoughts, just vibes. Let’s see where this goes.
